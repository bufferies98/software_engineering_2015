## Entry Level
Solve as many tasks from VhodnoNivo as you can.
   - tasks are located at https://github.com/thebravoman/software_engineering_2014/blob/master/vhodno_nivo/VhodnoNivo.pdf
   - create a folder named FirstName_LastName in software_engineering_2015/VhodnoNivo
   - create a separate file for every tasks you have solved.
   - name the files FirstName_LastName_{tasknumber} where tasknumber is the number of the task
   - commit all the files

## Quadratic equation
### Why

To learn simple Ruby programs, how to process command line arguments and how to work with numbers in Ruby.

### What
Implement a Ruby program for solving Quadratic equation - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation
  The program solves an equation from the kind ax^2+bx+c=0 and is run on the command line by passign three arguments:
  
> `ruby my_program a b c`
  
  As a result the program returns the solutions x1,x2 on the standard output separated by a ","
  If there is only one solution, then only one solution is returned.
  
  The program is named Class_Number_FirstName_LastName.rb where "Class" is only one capital letter - "A" or "B" and number is from 1 to 30
  Commit this solution in software_engineering_2015/class1_hm_quadratic_equation
