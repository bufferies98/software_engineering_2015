# Class excersize
Implement a program for automatically checking the programs from class1 homeworks and if they work correctly

## Travers directory
List all the files in the current directory

```ruby
Dir.glob("*").each do |file|
	p file
end
```

## Split file name
Process the files from class1 homework and outputs the Class,Number,FirstName,LastName of each students

```ruby
Dir.glob(ARGV[0]+"*").each do |file|
	result = file.split("/").last.split("_")
	p "#{result[0]},#{result[1]},#{result[2]},#{result[3]].split(".").first}"
end
```

**Note**: Regex are better solution, but it is still early in the course.

# check homeworks
Execute a program as a ruby program by passing parameters 1 3 2. The solution of the quadratic equation with this params should be -1,-2

```ruby
Dir.glob(ARGV[0]+"*").each do |file|
	result = file.split("/").last.split("_")
	p "#{result[0]},#{result[1]},#{result[2]},#{result[3].split(".").first}"
	p `ruby #{file} 1 3 2`
end
```

# Homeworks

## Task 1
1. Improve the class1_hm programs to output in the correct format. 

* Solutions to the quadratic equation should be on the same line separated with comma, ordered in ASCENDING order:
> x1,x2

* If there is only one solution the output should be:
> x1

* If there are not solutions then no value should be printed at the standard output:

## Verion 1 of Counting Words
2. Create a program for counting words in a text file. Use method split. The name of the file is passed as first command line argument.

The program is run as:
> ruby my_program file.txt

At the standard output the output should be the word followed by comma followed by the number of occurences. On the next line is the next word and so on for all the words in the file:

> first_word,7

> second_word,3

> n_work,1


Output should be sorted by the number of word occurences DESCENDING.
If there are two words with the same number of occurences they should be sorted ASCENDING.

### Submit
A file called Class_Number_FirstName_LastName in folder count_words
