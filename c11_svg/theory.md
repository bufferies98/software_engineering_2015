## Homework V6 for Counting words

Improve V5 so that it generates a SVG file called Class_Number_FirstName_LastName.svg that shows a graphic with the distirbution of the words.
For the graphic use Bars. 

So the program counts, and works as version 5 but it also generates a SVG. The program should always generate a SVG even if there are not parameters passed.

The design of the SVG is up to you. You can choose anything as long as it shows a clear picture with relation between the bars so that the first bar is the larges and the last is the smalles
