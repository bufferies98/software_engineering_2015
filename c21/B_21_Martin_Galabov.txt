M1
1.Take photographs
Take many photographs to use for the photogrammetry process for creation 3d models for the game
2.Research and create diffuse albedo masks
The 3D models created by the photogrammetry are lighted. We need to de-light them.
3.Create collision masks
The 3D objects need a collision mask so that the player doesn't just walk through them.
4.Create LODs
Create different levels of detail for the objects so that the game is optimised
5.Create UVs
Create UV masks for the objects for realistic lighting
6.Create materials
Import the created materials into untreal and build them
7.Create an early sketch of the first level
Draw a sketch for the first level so that we can plan the objects needed and start building the terrain
8.Start building a plan for the puzzles and the materials and objects needed for their creation
9.Start building the level
10.Position the fog effects
11.Position the lighting effects
12.Position the reflection samplers
13.Position the basic elements of the level
14.Build collision blueprints and events where needed
15.Position secondary elements such as grass, particle streams and puddles
M2
1.Main character
Start discussing the main character and think of how he should look and behave
2.Draw the main character
3.Rig the main character
Develop basic rigging for the character to be used for animation later
4.Apply materials
5.Discuss clothing and styles
6.Create clothing and animate it correctly
7.Import the character into Unreal
8.Test for blue hells
9.Story
The game needs a story so at this poinr we should probably start writing some lines for the character
10.Start animating the character and begin creatin at lest some of the story-driven animations
11.Begin creating the gameplay elements
12.Voice acting
13.Use audio software to make the recordings game-suitable
14.Research surround sound systems built into Unreal
15.Implement the recordings and listen for audio quality
M3
1.Begin recording the dialogue
2.Record sound effects
3.Record ambient effects
4.Implement the above
5.Create collectables for the game
6.Position the collectables in hard to dsicover places
7.App Store vs. Google Play (The war that never ends!!!)
8.Create a save game system
9.Choose chackpoints for auto-save feature
10.Begin testing the game on some devices to see if there are in-game bugs or the game isn't performing to design
This will require us to install OS X on a machine, export the Unreal projects to .apk files and then import them to Xcode
11.Create a Logo 
12.Create a main menu 
13.Create loading screens 
14.Create options menu
15.Price
Research the prices that are best for the client and for us
16.Finishing touches
17.A great battle between us and the App Store/ Google Play
18.Publish
19.Monetize
